As can be seen in the Tumor Response to Treatment plot, of the four drugs, only Capomulin caused a reduction in tumor volume. The other drugs analyzed had a tumor volume that was similar to the placebo. 

In the plot for Metastatic Spread one can observe that all mice had metastatic spread. However, the mice that took Capomulin had the slowest metastatic spread. 

In the plot for Survival Rate we can observe that over 80% of the mice taking Capomullin survived during the trial. 

Accounting for percent change of tumor volume and the conclusions before these we can say with some confidence that Capomulin was the most effective drug from the sample that was studied.
